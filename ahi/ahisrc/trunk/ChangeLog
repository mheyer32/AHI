2002-02-24  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released AHI preferences 5.4.

	* AHI: Increased driver info buffers from 32 to 64 characters.

2002-02-09  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* toccata.audio: The CPU load check now also includes the
	PlayerFunc.

2002-01-20  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* The '-s' flag is not used when stripping the binaries anymore.
	This way, the Amithlon binaries can be stripped too.

	* ahi.device: Say hello to the "Fast" modes again. This time,
	instead of being removed, they are added to the database but never
	returned by AHI_NextAudioID(), meaning that they will never show
	up in mode requesters etc. They are still available in
	AHI_AllocAudio(), though, and behave just like the "non-HiFi"
	modes: one multiplication/sample and no assembler optimization.
	
2002-01-06  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released ahi.device 5.21.

	* ahi.device: Re-enabled optimization and removed all 64 bit
	kludges for the Amithlon version. It's still just using the C
	version of the mixing routines, but is already about 2.5 times
	faster native (compared to the JIT-compiled 4.180 version). I like
	it.

	* paula.audio: When opening timer.device (used in the DMA mode),
	I didn't clear the flags parameter and opened UNIT_MICROHZ instead
	of UNIT_ECLOCK. [Sigbjørn Skjæret]

2002-01-03  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* toccata.audio: The PreTimer() and PostTimer() calls did not pass
	the required argument.

	* ahi.device: "elfloader.h" was included even when it's not used.

2002-01-02  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Updated the Hungarian catalogs. [Márton Dósa]

2001-12-29  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* When cross-building, the wrong 'strip' was used on the binaries.

2001-12-22  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Added a note about AHIA_PlayerFunc in the autodocs.

2001-12-21  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released AHI preferences 5.3.

	* Released ahi.device 5.20.

	* Added alpha support for Amithlon/native x86. Go ahead, try it,
	but do save your work first ... Then enjoy the fireworks!

	* Fixed some minor stuff in the AHI preferences so I can build
	native MorphOS/Amithlon versions of it. Why? Because I can.

	* The change in the mode file handling on 2001-07-29 seems to have
	made AHI_LoadModeFile() return failure if the argument was a
	directory. Now it always returns success in that case.

2001-12-19  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* If the device's init routine failed, the device memory was not
	freed and the libraries that had been opened were not closed.

	* Tweaked some things so I can cross-compile better.

	* Rewrote the last m68k assembler-only file in C. Whoo... The
	MorphOS version is finally feature-complete.

2001-12-14  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released AHI preferences 5.2.

	* AHI: It's now possible to test the selected audio mode by
	pressing the "Play a test sound" button.

2001-12-14  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released ahi.device 5.19.
	
	* When adding an audio mode file, ahi.device now verifies that the
	driver can be opened before adding the modes to the database. If a
	driver refuses to load if its hardware is not present, the useless
	modes will thus not be added. Driver authors, feel free to make sure
	your drivers behave like this.

2001-12-13  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released filesave.audio version 2.11.

	* filesave.audio:  Added RIFF WAVE output.

2001-11-26  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* ahi.device:  Added a couple of validation checks for mode files.

	* Released AddAudioModes 5.2.

	* AddAudioModes: The REFRESH flag now removes the audio mode
	database before (re-) scanning DEVS:AudioModes for mode files.

2001-09-29  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released ahi.device 5.17.

	* I tweaked the build environment somewhat:  makedepend is out; gcc
	-MM is in, even in AmigaOS.  "make all" now aborts on errors, as it
	should. All automatically generated files (version.h, localize.*)
	are now build before the dependencies are created.

	* ahi.device:  Haha!  I found the race condition in question!  It
	was in AddWriter(), which assumed that no free channel
	automatically implied that PlayingList was non-empty.  Not so!
	[Stephan Rupprecht and Harald Frank]

	* ahi.device:  Fixed yet another potential race condition (in
	SoundFunc()).  Sooner or later I *will* find the real one, won't I?

	* ahi.device:  Fixed a bug in TermIO (ioreq->ahir_Extras is now set
	to NULL before its FreeVec'ed, not after).

2001-09-28  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released paula.audio version 4.27.

	* paula.audio:  I broke the DMA playback mode in the last update.
	Fixed now. [Sigbjørn Skjæret]

2001-09-24  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* ahi.device:  A missing 'break' statement made AbortIO() return
	IOERR_NOCMD on CMD_WRITE requests.

	* ahi.device:  Fixed a non-fatal race condition in DevAbortIO().
	It just made the source code look prettier ...  :) Now if I could
	only find the one that makes AHI crash in AMIthlon ...

2001-09-16  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released paula.audio version 4.26.

	* Released ahi.device 5.8.

2001-09-09  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* paula.audio:  The fixed CMD_STOP/CMD_START in ahi.device
	triggered a bug that could make the driver lose track of the
	AHIsub_Disable and AHIsub_Enable nesting.  Also, these functions
	was not "thread safe" (they are not actually called from a thread
	but rather an interrupt).

2001-09-04  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* ahi.device:  Hopefully, CMD_STOP/CMD_START actually work now.

	* ahi.device:  Fixed a dead-lock problem that could happen when
	more than one double-buffered sound was played using the device
	API.

2001-07-29  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

        * ahi.device:  If a file in Devs:AudioModes is not a legal mode
	file, the scanning code would just stop.  Now, such errors are
	silently ignored.

2001-04-22  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

        * ahi.device:  When using a filter hook with the audio mode
	requester, and AHIR_DoDefaultMode was TRUE, the hook would receive
	AHI_INVALID_ID instead of the user-selected default mode ID.

2001-04-21  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released ahi.device 5.7.

	* ahi.device The default PlayerFunc (which is used unless the
	application provides one) did not have an m68k wrapper when the
	device was compiled for ppc, making ReqAttack (and many other
	programs, I guess) crash. [Jaca/D-CAPS]

2001-04-12  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* PAULA: Always use calibration tables for 14-bit output.

2001-03-29  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

        * Released ahi.device 5.6.

	* ahi.device:  Fixed a bug in the mixing routine that, when using
	"anti-click", caused notes to be lost in rare cases.  Credits to
	Jaca/D-CAPS for spotting it and sending me an example that
	reproduced the bug!

2001-03-11  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

        * Released ahi.device 5.5.

	* ahi.device:  Nuked one more m68k assembler source file and moved
	the code to C.

	* ahi.device: Stopped using dprintf in MorphOS.

2001-03-04  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

        * Released ahi.device 5.4.

	* ahi.device Fixed a bug that caused clicks on every new sound
	start, if an end-of-sound had been reached and the last sample in
	that sound was not 0.

2000-11-28  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released AHI 5.1.

	* Last-minute bugfixing for AmigsOS 3.9 CD.
