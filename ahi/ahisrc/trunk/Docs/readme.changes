     ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
     This version of AHI adds "anti-click" mixing routines, playback of
     32 bit samples and and support for the PowerPC microprocessor
     (currently MorphOS only).

     The 68000 processor is no longer supported; a 68020 or better is
     required.

     The "fast" audio modes are no longer used. They will not be shown
     in the audio mode requester.

     The non-HiFi modes are not any faster than the HiFi modes. They are
     just present because some music sound "better" when no interpolation
     is used.

     ChangeLog file.
