To configure on an Amiga:

sh configure --host=m68k-unknown-amigaos


To configure on a PC running Linux:

./configure --host=m68k-amigaos --build=i686-pc-linux-gnu


You can build in separate directories, which is very useful when
working on the PPC version:

mkdir build060
cd build060
sh ../ahisrc/configure --host=m68k-unknown-amigaos


The following targets are available:

all:
	Makes all binaries, but only one version of the device.

clean:
	Removes all binaries and temporary files.

distclean:
	Like clean, but also removes files created by 'configure'.

maintainer-clean:
	Removes all machine-generated files, including the autoconf files.

bindist:
	Builds the binary distribution.  You can change the directory in
	which the binary distribution will be created, by setting the
	variable DISTDIR. The default is '/tmp/ahi'. This will build all
	possible versions of the device, including the PowerUp version.

revup:
	Increases the revision of the distribution.


When you add code, please remember a few things:

   Avoid TAB characters, if possible.
   The TAB size is 8.
   The indent level is 2.
   Compiler warnings are NOT acceptable.
