        * If a file in Devs:AudioModes is not a legal mode file, the
	scanning code would just stop.  Now, such errors are silently
	ignored.

        * When using a filter hook with the audio mode requester, and 
	AHIR_DoDefaultMode was TRUE, teh hook would receive AHI_INVALID_ID
	instead of the user-selected default mode ID.

	* Released ahi.device 5.7.

	* The default PlayerFunc (which is used unless the application
	provides one) did not have an m68k wrapper when the device was
	compiled for ppc, making ReqAttack (and many other programs, I
	guess) crash. [Jaca/D-CAPS]

        * Released ahi.device 5.6.

	* Fixed a bug in the mixing routine that, when using "anti-click",

	spotting it and sending me an example that reproduced the bug!

        * Released ahi.device 5.4.

	if an end-of-sound had been reached and the last sample in that
	sound was not 0.
