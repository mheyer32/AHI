	* Released paula.audio version 4.27.

	* paula.audio:  I broke the DMA playback mode in the last update.
	Fixed now.

	* ahi.device:  A missing 'break' statment made AbortIO() return
	IOERR_NOCMD on CMD_WRITE requests.

	* ahi.device:  Fixed a non-fatal race condition in DevAbortIO().
	It just made the source code look prettier ... :)

	* Released paula.audio version 4.26.

	* Released ahi.device 5.8.

2001-09-09  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* paula.audio:  The fixed CMD_STOP/CMD_START in ahi.device
	triggered a bug that could make the driver lose track of the
	AHIsub_Disable and AHIsub_Enable nesting.  Also, these functions
	was not "thread safe" (they are not actually called from a thread
	but rather an interrupt).

	* ahi.device:  Hopefully, CMD_STOP/CMD_START actually work now.

	* ahi.device:  Fixed a dead-lock problem that could happen when
	more than one double-buffered sound was played using the device
	API.

        * ahi.device:  If a file in Devs:AudioModes is not a legal mode
	file, the scanning code would just stop.  Now, such errors are
	silently ignored.

        * When using a filter hook with the audio mode requester, and
	AHIR_DoDefaultMode was TRUE, the hook would receive AHI_INVALID_ID
	instead of the user-selected default mode ID.

	* Released ahi.device 5.7.

	* The default PlayerFunc (which is used unless the application
	provides one) did not have an m68k wrapper when the device was
	compiled for ppc, making ReqAttack (and many other programs, I
	guess) crash. [Jaca/D-CAPS]

	* PAULA: Always use calibration tables for 14-bit output.

2001-03-29  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

        * Released ahi.device 5.6.

	* Fixed a bug in the mixing routine that, when using "anti-click",
	caused notes to be lost in rare cases. Credits to Jaca/D-CAPS for
	spotting it and sending me an example that reproduced the bug!

2001-03-11  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

        * Released ahi.device 5.5.

	* Nuked one more m68k assembler source file and moved the code
	to C.

	* Stopped using dprintf in MorphOS.

2001-03-04  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

        * Released ahi.device 5.4.

	* Fixed a bug that caused clicks on every new sound start,
	if an end-of-sound had been reached and the last sample in that
	sound was not 0.

2000-11-28  Martin Blom  <martin@blom.org>

	* Released AHI 5.1.

	* Last-minute bugfixing for AmigsOS 3.9 CD.
